# Medical_Image_Analysis

### Topic-
AI-Powered Multipurpose Web platform for Medical Image Analysis

### Abstract-
This projectâ€™s main aim is to provide assistance to medical practitioners and a reliable second opinion to people without medical background about diseases that can be detected from medical images or scans taken by medical professionals or people themselves. The diseases covered under this project are fatal if not detected in their early stages. Since people and professionals are not equipped with adequate resources so many cases concerning these may go undetected and possibly endanger lives or chronic ailments. 
The platform analyses these medical images and classifies them under various classes using the power of artificial intelligence. This app is designed to provide accurate, reliable and swift results. This app detects diseases such as Skin cancer from skin images, Tuberculosis from X-ray scans, Pneumonia from chest X-ray, Diabetes from retinopathy samples and Malaria from blood samples.
